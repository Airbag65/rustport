# rustport
`rustport` is a CLI client for [`passport`](https://github.com/Airbag65/passport/) written in, as the name implies, rust. `rustport` comes with a `justfile` for easier running, building and installing.
For a list of the possible things you can do run:
```bash
 just -l
```
If you have no intentions of expanding upon `rustport` and just simply wish to use it, you can run:
```bash
 just install
 # or use the shorthand
 just i
```
